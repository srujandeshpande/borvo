## How does Borvo help?
Borvo promotes transparency and efficiency of processing health records and insurance claims while ensuring security and immutability of data to prevent unauthorized access and eliminate fraud.

## How does Borvo work?
Borvo is used by 3 categories of users:
1. **Patients**  
Patients can view their medical records, view prescriptions and see the status of their insurance claims
2. **Hospitals and Doctors**  
Hospitals and Doctors are incharge of entering the data into the system. Borvo replaces any pre-existing system and ensures fast processing with minimal paperwork. Doctors can enter details of consulatations and add billing information.
3. **Insurance Providers**  
Insurance Providers can view individual claims made by patients and be sure that they are verified by the hospital thanks to the use of Blockchain technology. Insurers can approve or deny claims and view past records for patient claims to prevent fraud.

## What technology does Borvo run on?
Borvo is built on the Ethereum Blockchain. The smart contract is authored in Solidity and the frontend is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This application is deployed to the **Ropsten Testnet**. **Matic** will be used in future implementations.
